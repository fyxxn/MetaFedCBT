## Usage

## 1.Data 
This project uses multi-view brain connectivity data from the public ABIDE-I dataset (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange), which includes two groups: Normal Control (NC) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The data is divided by left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH).

## 2.Results 
These figures compare CBTs of a population of subjects where each subject has 6 views (each represented by 35 by 35 matrix). Our code takes in a numpy array of size [35, 35, 6] and outputs a 35 by 35 matrix.
